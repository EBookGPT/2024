This screenplay reads more like a political commentary than a compelling narrative. While it attempts to satirize the 2024 election, it falls flat due to its reliance on "telling" rather than "showing" and a lack of engaging dialogue. Here's a breakdown of the issues and suggestions for improvement:

**1. Lack of Narrative Drive:**

* **The story feels static:** There's no real plot, just a series of scenes showcasing Trump's rallies and Biden's speeches. Where's the conflict, the tension, the stakes?
* **No character development:** Trump and Biden are presented as caricatures, with no depth or internal conflict. We see their public personas, but not who they are as individuals.
* **The "montage" is a crutch:** Instead of showing us events, the script relies on montages to summarize key moments. This is lazy storytelling. 

**Solution:**

* **Give the screenplay a clear plot:**  Introduce a conflict that drives the story.  Maybe there's a controversial bill being debated, or a foreign policy crisis, or a scandal that rocks the campaign. This will give the characters something to react to and create tension.
* **Develop your characters:** Give Trump and Biden internal struggles, flaws, and desires. How are they affected by the pressure of the campaign? Are they secretly struggling with the weight of their decisions?
* **Show, don't tell:**  Instead of describing Trump's rallies or Biden's speeches, create scenes that immerse the audience in the energy and atmosphere. Let us experience the events, not just hear about them.

**2. Uninspired Dialogue:**

* **The dialogue is bland:** The speeches are filled with generic political rhetoric.  Where's the humor, the wit, the sarcasm that would make this satire truly sharp?
* **The dialogue is predictable:** We already know what Trump and Biden are going to say. There's no sense of surprise or discovery.

**Solution:**

* **Write dialogue that reveals character:** Give Trump and Biden unique voices. What are their mannerisms, their catchphrases, their quirks? Let their words reveal their true personalities, even when they're putting on a public face.
* **Use dialogue to create conflict:** Instead of just making speeches, have Trump and Biden engage in witty banter, heated arguments, or even just awkward silences. This will create tension and keep the audience interested.
* **Find the humor in the situation:** Satire thrives on the unexpected. Look for the comedic potential in the situations you present and find ways to make the audience laugh.

**3. Missed Opportunity for Visual Satire:**

* **The visuals are too literal:** The script relies heavily on obvious imagery (Trump's rallies, Biden's somber speeches) to get the point across.  This lacks subtlety and creativity.
* **The satire is too broad:**  The humor feels forced and obvious.  Where's the sharp wit, the biting social commentary?

**Solution:**

* **Use visual metaphors:**  Find creative ways to represent the political landscape.  Maybe a giant, empty building symbolizes the emptiness of Trump's promises, or a broken mirror reflects the fractured state of the nation.
* **Embrace the absurd:**  Don't be afraid to exaggerate and push the boundaries of reality.  Let the visuals be over-the-top, even surreal, to emphasize the absurdity of the situation.
* **Find the humor in the details:**  Pay attention to the small details, the little quirks, the everyday occurrences that reveal the bigger picture. 

**Overall, the screenplay has potential but needs significant work to become a truly compelling and humorous piece of satire. By focusing on plot, character, and visual language, you can create a screenplay that will not only entertain but also offer a fresh and insightful commentary on the political landscape.**
